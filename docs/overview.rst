SIMURAN overview
================

Project purpose
---------------
SIMURAN is designed to help manage parameters and configuration files for large experiments in neuroscience. Particularly those involving analysing recordings performed in multiple brain regions simultaneously.

It is very much a work in progress, and will be subject to change. The overall idea is to provide a UI to manage parameters and configuration files by using XML files which are rendered as a network.

Why the name?
-------------
SIMURAN stands for **Si**\ multaneous **Mu**\ lti-\ **R**\ egion **An**\ alysis. It is also a giant of the underworld in Philippine Mythology, which seems fitting given the difficulty of analysing large recordings.
